### Completed Cross-Cutting Capabilities

- Centralized structured logging using Spring Boot ECS JSON console output
- Distributed tracing using Micrometer Tracing, Brave, and Zipkin-compatible export
- Trace observation for HTTP requests and RabbitMQ publishers/listeners
- RabbitMQ retry and dead-letter handling for Profile and Notification consumers
- Three listener attempts with exponential backoff before failed messages are republished to `eshoppingzone.dlq`
- Customer-specific recommendations based on repeated product views

The service business workflows remain under active testing. The observability and messaging foundations are implemented without changing existing service queue names or event routing keys.

## Recommendation Service

The Recommendation Service provides a customer-specific, rule-based recommendation flow. It does not use machine learning, AI, embeddings, or a shared global product-view count.

### Recommendation Rule

When an authenticated customer views the same active product three or more times:

```text
Customer 101 views Product 501:
1st view -> count 1 -> not recommended
2nd view -> count 2 -> not recommended
3rd view -> count 3 -> recommended
4th view -> count 4 -> remains recommended
```

View counts are tracked independently for each `(customer_id, product_id)` pair, so one customer's views never create recommendations for another customer.

### Recommendation API

```text
GET /api/v1/recommendations
```

The endpoint requires a valid access-token JWT. The authenticated customer's `userId` claim determines which recommendations are returned; a customer cannot request another customer's recommendations.

Example response data:

```json
[
  {
    "productId": 501,
    "reason": "VIEW_COUNT_THRESHOLD"
  }
]
```

### Product View Event Flow

After a successful authenticated request to:

```text
GET /api/v1/products/{id}
```

Product Service publishes a `PRODUCT_VIEWED` event. Anonymous product browsing remains supported, but anonymous views are not associated with a customer and therefore do not affect recommendations.

The event uses the existing RabbitMQ topic exchange:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Exchange | `eshoppingzone.exchange` |
| Routing key | `eshoppingzone.product.viewed` |
| Queue | `eshoppingzone.recommendation.product.viewed.queue` |

Recommendation Service consumes the event and atomically increments the customer's product-view record. RabbitMQ redelivery and concurrent events are handled with a unique `(customer_id, product_id)` constraint and an atomic database upsert.

### Recommendation Persistence

Recommendation Service uses a separate MySQL schema:

```text
eshoppingzone_recommendation
```

The `customer_product_view` table stores:

```text
customer_id
product_id
view_count
recommended
first_viewed_at
last_viewed_at
created_at
updated_at
```

The `(customer_id, product_id)` pair is unique. `recommended` is `false` below three views and `true` at three or more views.

### Recommendation Service Configuration

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Service name | `recommendation-service` |
| Default port | `8091` |
| Eureka registration | Enabled |
| MySQL schema | `eshoppingzone_recommendation` |
| Gateway path | `/api/v1/recommendations/**` |
| Gateway destination | `lb://RECOMMENDATION-SERVICE` |

Service-specific configuration is in [recommendation-service.yml](config-repo/recommendation-service.yml). The gateway route is defined in [api-gateway.yml](config-repo/api-gateway.yml) and the gateway's local [application.yml](api-gateway/src/main/resources/application.yml).

## Local Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Maven 3.9 or later
- MySQL
- RabbitMQ
- Zipkin, or another collector compatible with the configured Zipkin endpoint

The default local endpoints are:

| Component | Default endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| Eureka | `http://localhost:8761` |
| Config Server | `http://localhost:8888` |
| RabbitMQ | `localhost:5672` |
| Zipkin | `http://localhost:9411` |

Start the parent build from the repository root:

```bash
./mvnw clean verify
```

On Windows, use `mvnw.cmd clean verify`. The Maven Wrapper downloads Maven 3.9.9 into `.mvn/wrapper/dists` on first use.

Every push and pull request targeting `main`, `master`, or `develop` runs the same command through [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/ci.yml). The workflow uses Java 21, Maven dependency caching, and uploads Surefire reports when tests fail.

## Automated Testing

The repository contains JUnit 5 and Mockito unit tests for each business service and the API Gateway filters. Additional focused tests cover the Profile and Notification RabbitMQ DLQ declarations and listener factory wiring. Run unit tests with:

```bash
./mvnw test
```

The Profile module includes a Testcontainers integration test that starts RabbitMQ in Docker and verifies the real DLX-to-DLQ route. `./mvnw verify` runs these `*IT` tests through Maven Failsafe, so Docker must be available for the full build. Unit tests remain Docker-free.

The API Gateway includes an opt-in end-to-end health smoke test. Run it against an already running gateway with:

```bash
E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 ./mvnw -pl api-gateway -De2e.run=true verify
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:E2E_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8080"
./mvnw.cmd -pl api-gateway -De2e.run=true verify
```

The normal GitHub Actions CI job runs unit and RabbitMQ integration tests on Docker-enabled runners. The gateway E2E test remains opt-in because it requires a deployed gateway and its dependent services.

Configuration is loaded through the Config Server from [config-repo](config-repo). The most relevant environment variables are:

```text
EUREKA_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8761/eureka/
RABBITMQ_HOST=localhost
RABBITMQ_PORT=5672
RABBITMQ_USERNAME=guest
RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=<SET_A_SECURE_PASSWORD>
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=<SET_A_SECURE_PASSWORD>
JWT_SECRET=<SET_A_SECURE_SECRET>
ZIPKIN_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans
TRACING_SAMPLING_PROBABILITY=1.0
LOG_FORMAT=ecs
APP_ENVIRONMENT=local
```

Do not commit production credentials. Override database, RabbitMQ, JWT, and tracing values through deployment environment variables or a secured configuration repository.

## Observability

### Centralized Logging

The shared configuration in [config-repo/application.yml](config-repo/application.yml) enables ECS structured console output. Every service writes machine-readable JSON containing the service identity and logging context. This output can be collected by Fluent Bit, Filebeat, Logstash, or a container platform and forwarded to a centralized Elasticsearch-compatible logging system.

The service name comes from `spring.application.name`, while deployment metadata can be set with `SERVICE_VERSION`, `APP_ENVIRONMENT`, and `LOG_FORMAT` (`ecs` by default).

### Distributed Tracing

Micrometer Tracing with the Brave bridge is inherited from the parent [pom.xml](pom.xml). HTTP calls and asynchronous RabbitMQ operations use the trace context supplied by the framework. Spans are exported to `${ZIPKIN_ENDPOINT:http://localhost:9411/api/v2/spans}`.

Sampling is controlled with `TRACING_SAMPLING_PROBABILITY`. Use a lower value in production when full sampling is too expensive.

### RabbitMQ Dead-Letter Queue

Existing event queues remain unchanged. The Profile and Notification services define:

- Dead-letter exchange: `eshoppingzone.dlx`
- Dead-letter queue: `eshoppingzone.dlq`
- Dead-letter routing key: `failed`

Listener failures are retried three times with exponential backoff. After the final failure, `RepublishMessageRecoverer` republishes the original message and failure metadata to the DLX. This keeps failed events available for inspection or controlled replay instead of silently losing them.

### Request Flow

1. A client sends an HTTP request to the API Gateway.
2. Gateway filters authenticate the request and apply rate limiting.
3. The gateway resolves the destination through Eureka service discovery.
4. The target service handles the request and uses its configured database.
5. OpenFeign clients call other services where a synchronous response is required.
6. Micrometer tracing propagates the request trace across service boundaries and exports spans to Zipkin.
7. Services emit ECS JSON logs containing service and trace context for centralized collection.

### Event Flow

1. A business service publishes an event to the shared `eshoppingzone.exchange` RabbitMQ topic exchange.
2. Queues bind to event routing keys such as user, order, payment, delivery, and refund events.
3. Profile and Notification consumers process their subscribed events asynchronously.
4. Product Service publishes authenticated product-detail views using `eshoppingzone.product.viewed`.
5. Recommendation Service consumes product-view events and updates the customer/product view count.
6. RabbitMQ observation propagates trace context from the publisher to the consumer.
7. Consumer failures are retried locally; exhausted retries are republished to `eshoppingzone.dlx` and stored in `eshoppingzone.dlq`.

### Configuration Flow

1. Each service starts with service-specific configuration in `config-repo/<service-name>.yml`.
2. Shared infrastructure settings come from `config-repo/application.yml`.
3. Config Server exposes the merged configuration to registered services.
4. Environment variables override local defaults for deployment-specific values.
